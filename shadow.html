    <h1>Shadow Path Mechanic</h1>
    <p>A puzzle exploration prototype where the player can only move inside shadows.</p>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Shadow Path is an experimental mechanic prototype built in Unity. The core idea: the player can move
      <strong>only inside shadows</strong>, and must manipulate the world to cast new paths. This demo consists of three
      small handcrafted levels, each introducing a new mechanic layered on top of the previous one.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Level 1 -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Level 1 — Rotating Stage & Time‑of‑Day Control</h2>
    <p>
      The first level focuses on teaching the player how shadow-based traversal works. The core interactions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A / D</strong>: Rotate the entire stage to change how obstacles cast shadows.</li>
      <li><strong>W / S</strong>: Shift the time of day, altering the sun angle and shadow length.</li>
      <li>Movement is allowed only inside the shaded areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="video-container">
      <video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
        <source src="assets/shadow_level1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>

    <p>
      This level demonstrates the foundational logic: shadow projection, directional light manipulation, and
      boundary-based player movement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Level 2 -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Level 2 — Advanced Shadow Navigation</h2>
    <p>
      In the second level, the environment layout emphasizes a different use of the mechanic. Instead of simple
      rotations, the player must strategically combine lighting changes and environmental geometry to reach distant
      platforms.
    </p>

    <div class="video-container">
      <video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
        <source src="assets/shadow_level2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>

    <p>
      This level showcases more complex shadow logic and how simple geometry can create emergent puzzle paths.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Level 3 -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Level 3 — Expanding Tower Mechanic</h2>
    <p>
      The final level introduces a new system: an <strong>expandable tower</strong> that rises to connect shadow paths.
      The player must extend or contract the tower while adjusting the sunlight angle to cast a continuous shaded
      walkway leading to the goal.
    </p>

    <div class="video-container">
      <video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
        <source src="assets/shadow_level3.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>

    <p>
      This demonstrates the layering of mechanics and system interactions — dynamic geometry + real‑time lighting.
